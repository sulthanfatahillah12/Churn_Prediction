# Churn_Prediction

Overview

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn in a bank dataset (10,000 customers, 12 features). Multiple models were tested (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Stacking, Voting, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, XGBoost) with hyperparameter tuning.

Key findings:
	•	Best metric: F3-Score, since the business case prioritizes identifying churners.
	•	Business cost analysis: Without ML, the bank spends $8,140 on retention, while with ML the cost increases to $10,880, showing that the current ML model is not yet cost-effective.
