# Churn_Prediction

Overview

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn in a bank dataset (10,000 customers, 12 features). Multiple models were tested (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Stacking, Voting, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, XGBoost) with hyperparameter tuning.

# Customer Churn Prediction


- Models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Stacking, Voting, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, XGBoost.  
- Best metric: **F3-Score** (prioritizing churn detection).  
- Business cost analysis:  
  - Without ML â†’ **$8,140** retention cost.  
  - With ML â†’ **$10,880** cost.  

ðŸ‘‰ Current ML model is **not yet cost-effective** compared to the baseline strategy.
